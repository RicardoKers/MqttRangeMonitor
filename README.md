# MqttRangeMonitor
MqttRangeMonitor is a Python application that subscribes to one or more MQTT topics and checks incoming numeric values against specified minimum and maximum ranges, with an optional hysteresis for each topic. If a value goes out of range, the application sends an alert message via Telegram.
